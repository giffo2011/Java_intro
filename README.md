  2. This project was for practicing my intro to javascript skills.As you navigate this website 
you will see that it revolves around a ficticious establishment named "Golf Adventure."
There are several pages including a contact page, an about page, and a pricing page.
There are several features I would like the highlight regarding the website. Notice the
responsiveness of the features, especially the navigation bar. On my last project I had trouble
making the hamburger menu work when the webpage was being viewed in a smaller window. Now,
the navbar is fully functional and includes bootstrap animations for all the selections.

On the home page there are cards boasting features of the mini golf course. It made sense to 
use the homepage to advertise some of the virtues of this golf course, but I decided it 
was beyond the scope of the project to add a page that went into further detail on these features. 

The about page is very brief. I simply added this page to give a brief history of Adventure Golf.

The contact page is important for registering for golf sessions.

The pricing page is very important to the website. I wanted customers to be informed on 
seasonal deals and group discounts that are available to them during the summer. Also, notice that the attached javascript includes several functions for calculating information from this page.

The assets folder holds all the picture files that the website is dependant on.

There is an attached CSS style folder. I tried to do the absolute bare minimum CSS styling 
on this project; I wanted to use it as an opportunity to expand my bootstrap skills.

Lastly, a javascript file takes up the rear of this project. I did not try to link it 
to the wesite and have all the functions built to theoretically support the website 
and provide for potential needs of the website.
